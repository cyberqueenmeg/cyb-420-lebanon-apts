    <div style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px;">
        <h1>Offensive Cyber Strategy</h1>
        
        <h2>Cyber Espionage Operation Overview</h2>
        <p>This cyber espionage operation involves Lebanon targeting the financial infrastructure of a neighboring country. The operation aims to infiltrate financial institutions, such as banks and regulatory agencies, to access sensitive economic data, monitor financial transactions, and identify vulnerabilities. This intelligence gathering could support Lebanon in gaining political or economic leverage.</p>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The main goal is to gain access to financial institutions, extract critical financial data, and potentially alter transactions for intelligence benefits. The operation could involve phishing campaigns, custom malware, and network infiltrations using compromised credentials.</p>
        
        <h3>Recommended Cyber Tools/Weapons</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Customized Phishing Toolkit</strong> <br>
                <em>Purpose:</em> To gain initial access by impersonating trusted entities and deceiving financial employees into sharing credentials or clicking malicious links. <br>
                <em>Explanation:</em> Phishing serves as an entry point for further infiltration, and customized messages tailored to the institution increase success by mimicking real communications.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Remote Access Trojan (RAT)</strong> <br>
                <em>Purpose:</em> Allows operators to control infected computers remotely within the network, enabling data extraction and monitoring. <br>
                <em>Explanation:</em> RATs provide ongoing access to sensitive systems, allowing data collection over extended periods.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Network Packet Sniffer</strong> <br>
                <em>Purpose:</em> Intercepts network traffic to capture transactional data, login credentials, and other sensitive information.<br>
                <em>Explanation:</em> Real-time network traffic monitoring allows the operation to analyze financial data and potentially manipulate transactions.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Legal Issues in Authorized Cyber Operations</h3>
        <p>Cyber espionage operates in a legally gray area internationally, especially since these operations often avoid direct physical damage. Here are some of the main legal frameworks that address aspects of cyber operations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>UN Charter on Sovereignty and Non-Intervention:</strong> This foundational document emphasizes state sovereignty and non-interference. Cyber espionage does not clearly fall under "use of force," but it may still be seen as a breach of sovereignty if it interferes with another state's internal affairs.</li>
            <li><strong>Tallinn Manual on Cyber Warfare:</strong> Although not legally binding, this manual offers expert interpretations of how international law could apply to cyber conflicts, including discussions on sovereignty and non-intervention in cyberspace.</li>
            <li><strong>Budapest Convention on Cybercrime:</strong> This treaty focuses on preventing cybercrime, especially unauthorized access and data interception. While aimed more at individual cybercrime, its guidelines are relevant to unauthorized access and monitoring involved in cyber espionage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tools, Techniques, Technology, and Data Use Summary</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Customized Phishing Toolkit, Remote Access Trojan (RAT), Network Packet Sniffer.</li>
            <li><strong>Techniques:</strong> Social engineering (phishing), credential harvesting, data exfiltration, and network traffic interception.</li>
            <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Email spoofing, malware persistence, and encrypted covert channels for secure data extraction.</li>
            <li><strong>Data:</strong> Financial records, transaction logs, and login credentials analyzed to understand economic patterns and potentially manipulate transactions.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Defensive Cyber Strategy Section -->
    <div style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px;">
        <h1>Defensive Cyber Strategy</h1>

        <h2>Overview of the Defense Strategy</h2>
        <p>This strategy is aimed at protecting financial institutions from cyber espionage by detecting, preventing, and mitigating unauthorized access and data exfiltration attempts. The strategy includes proactive monitoring, incident response, and secure data management to counter cyber intrusions.</p>

        <h3>Recommended Defensive Tools/Weapons</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS)</strong> <br>
                <em>Purpose:</em> Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and can block potential threats in real-time. <br>
                <em>Explanation:</em> An IDPS can detect and block unauthorized access attempts, protecting financial systems from phishing and RAT deployment by monitoring for abnormal activity.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Data Loss Prevention (DLP) System</strong> <br>
                <em>Purpose:</em> Ensures sensitive data is not sent outside of the secure network, preventing unauthorized exfiltration. <br>
                <em>Explanation:</em> DLP tools can detect and block attempts to transfer sensitive financial data, countering any network sniffer tools used by attackers.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)</strong> <br>
                <em>Purpose:</em> Provides continuous monitoring of endpoints to detect and respond to threats, including malware and suspicious activity. <br>
                <em>Explanation:</em> EDR helps detect malware and RATs early, allowing for quick isolation and remediation on infected devices within the network.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Legal Issues in Defensive Cyber Operations</h3>
        <p>Defensive cyber operations are generally permitted under both national and international law. These protections fall under internal security measures aimed at protecting state and organizational data. Financial institutions, in particular, are subject to regulatory frameworks that mandate strong data security measures, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>National Data Protection and Privacy Laws:</strong> These laws mandate data protection for financial institutions, making cybersecurity defenses a legal obligation.</li>
            <li><strong>Industry Standards (e.g., PCI-DSS):</strong> For financial institutions, industry standards require strict protection of financial data, including measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tools, Techniques, Technology, and Data Use Summary</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tools:</strong> IDPS, DLP system, EDR.</li>
            <li><strong>Techniques:</strong> Anomaly detection, incident response, data encryption, and access restriction.</li>
            <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Machine learning for anomaly detection, secure encrypted communication, and automated incident response systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Data:</strong> Network logs, user activity records, and endpoint monitoring data to identify and respond to suspicious behavior.</li>
        </ul>
