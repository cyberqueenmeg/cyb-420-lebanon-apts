        <h1>US Doctrine</h1>
        <h2 style = "text-align: center;"> US Cyber Laws </h2>
        <h3> Federal Cyber Laws </h3>
        <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) 1986</h4>
        <li style="margin-left: 20px;">The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is a federal law criminalizing unauthorized access to computer systems. It is one of the primary laws for prosecuting cybercrime within the United States. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 is applicable when foreign threat actors or nation states engage in either hacking or cyber espionage against the United States. Any attack on critical infrastructure like financial systems, energy grids, or water plants can be prosecuted using the CFAA.</li>
        <br>
        <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) 2015</h4>
        <li style="margin-left: 20px;">The CISA is put in place to encourage the sharing of cybersecurity threat information between private sector and the federal government in order to protect critical infrastructure from the threat of cyberattacks. The CISA facilitates efforts between federal agencies and private companies to both identify and mitigate threats coming from foreign cyber threat actors. Because of this the overall cyber defense structure of the United States is increased over time making the United States a more secure country.</li>
        <br>
        <h3> State Level Cyber Laws </h3>
        <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) 2020</h4>
        <li style="margin-left: 20px;">The CCPA holds value to the scope of cybersecurity, while indirect, the CCPA holds companies accountable for protecting and using sensitive user data against malicious breaches which in turn can be used in cyberattacks against the state or the country. This law mandates that if a California citizen’s data is leaked it must be reported, this in turn encourages sophisticated cybersecurity measures by implementing strict data protection protocols and ensuring companies invest in advanced security systems to prevent breaches. </li>
        <br>
        <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New York SHIELD Act (2019)</h4>
        <li style="margin-left: 20px;">The New York SHIELD Act is a state law used to Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic Data Security (SHIELD). This act is put in place to increase data security requirements for businesses operating within New York making it a requirement to have adequate cybersecurity measures put in place as well as having a notification response about any potential sensitive data loss. The SHIELD Act helps businesses and corporations’ preparedness, in the event of a cyber attack as well as increasing the overall cybersecurity structure of them.</li>
