    <h2> The Law of War </h2>
    <br>
    <p> [DRAFT]
        Abstract
        This paper examines the four principles of warfare outlined in the Oxford Manual of 1880, focusing on the principle of distinction as the greatest legal challenge in modern warfare. The manual, a significant early effort to codify the laws of war, embodies concepts that have evolved into military necessity, humanity, distinction, and proportionality. Through analysis of these principles and their application in contemporary conflicts, this paper argues that distinction presents the most significant legal hurdles due to the evolving nature of warfare, urban combat scenarios, dual-use facilities, and technological advancements. The research draws on the original Oxford Manual and recent scholarly works to explore the complexities of applying the principle of distinction in 21st-century warfare.
        Keywords: Oxford Manual 1880, laws of war, principle of distinction, military necessity, humanity, proportionality
        
        The Oxford Manual of 1880, formally known as the "Manual on the Laws of War on Land," was a groundbreaking document in the codification of international humanitarian law. Developed by the Institute of International Law, it aimed to provide a comprehensive guide for the conduct of warfare (International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC], n.d.). While the Oxford Manual doesn't explicitly list four principles, it embodies several key concepts that have evolved into the modern principles of warfare. These can be interpreted as military necessity, humanity, distinction, and proportionality (Meron, 2000).
        Military Necessity
        The Manual recognizes that the goal of war is to weaken the military forces of the enemy. Article 4 states, "The laws of war do not recognize in belligerents an unlimited liberty as to the means of injuring the enemy" (ICRC, n.d.). This principle acknowledges that certain actions are necessary in warfare but places limits on what can be considered militarily necessary.
        Humanity
        The principle of humanity is evident throughout the Manual. For example, Article 9 prohibits the use of poison or poisoned weapons, demonstrating a concern for unnecessary suffering (ICRC, n.d.). This principle aims to mitigate the brutality of war and protect both combatants and civilians from excessive harm.
        Distinction
        The Manual emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between combatants and non-combatants. Article 7 states, "It is forbidden to maltreat inoffensive populations" (ICRC, n.d.). This principle forms the basis for modern laws protecting civilians in armed conflicts.
        Proportionality
        While not explicitly named, the concept of proportionality is present in the Manual. Article 15 prohibits the destruction of enemy property unless "imperatively demanded by the necessity of war" (ICRC, n.d.). This principle requires that military actions be balanced against potential civilian harm.
        Among these principles, distinction presents the greatest legal challenge in modern warfare. The Oxford Manual laid the groundwork for this principle, which has become increasingly complex in contemporary conflicts (Schmitt, 2010).
        Applying the principle of distinction in modern warfare presents significant challenges:
        Evolving Nature of Warfare: The Manual was written in an era of conventional warfare between states. Today's conflicts often involve non-state actors and asymmetric warfare, blurring the lines between combatants and civilians (Schmitt, 2010). This evolution makes it increasingly difficult to distinguish between legitimate military targets and protected persons or objects.
        Urban Warfare: Modern conflicts frequently occur in densely populated urban areas, where military objectives are often in close proximity to civilian structures. This proximity makes it challenging to target military objectives without risking civilian casualties or damage to civilian infrastructure (Boothby, 2012). The Oxford Manual did not anticipate the complexities of urban combat, which has become a dominant form of warfare in the 21st century.
        Dual-Use Facilities: Many facilities and infrastructure serve both civilian and military purposes. For example, power plants, communication networks, and transportation hubs may be used by both civilians and military forces. Determining the legality of attacking such targets becomes complex under the principle of distinction (Schmitt, 2010). The Manual does not address this modern reality, leaving a gap in its guidance.
        Technological Advancements: The Manual couldn't have anticipated the technological advancements in warfare, such as cyber warfare or autonomous weapons systems, which complicate the application of the distinction principle (Sass√≤li, 2019). These new forms of warfare challenge traditional notions of what constitutes a military objective and how to protect civilians in non-physical domains.
        The principle of distinction's legal challenges are further compounded by the severe consequences of violations. While the Oxford Manual doesn't specify penalties, it does state in Article 84 that "offenders against the rules of warfare are liable to the punishments specified in the penal or criminal law" (ICRC, n.d.). This underscores the importance of adhering to the principle of distinction and the potential legal ramifications for those who fail to do so.
        In conclusion, while the Oxford Manual of 1880 laid important groundwork for the laws of war, the principle of distinction it helped establish presents the greatest legal challenge in modern warfare. The complexity of contemporary conflicts, the blurring of lines between combatants and civilians, and the severe legal consequences of violations make this principle particularly challenging to apply (Meron, 2000; Schmitt, 2010). Addressing these challenges requires ongoing legal discourse and potentially new international agreements to adapt to the realities of 21st-century warfare.
