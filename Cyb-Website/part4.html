        <h3> Cyber Skills </h3>
        <p>
            The UK's support for allies in the Middle East, particularly in countering terrorism, may lead the NCF to engage in operations that indirectly or 
            directly impact Lebanon. This could involve intelligence-sharing or cyber actions aimed at stopping terrorist activities that threaten regional stability.
            Here are some of the skills that UK Cyber Force specializes in:
            <li>Malware Development: Creating and deploying malware to critical system to disrupt infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Intelligence Gathering-Information on Networks: The NCF conducts intelligence operations to get data on enemy networks, enabling them to expose certain key vulnerable points that could be used in future attacks.</li>
            <li>DoS Attacks: Overwhelming the online services to shut down governmental websites or key public services and therefore affect day-to-day operations​.</li>
            <li>Social Engineering: Get people to give out confidential information or perform an activity that can reveal security. By making use of psychological factors and creating persuasive stories, it will gain their confidence to provide access to restricted systems​</li>
            <li>Phishing: Deceive the targets to share internal information through impersonation of some sort</li><br>
        </p>
        <h3> Attack </h3>
        <p> It was a collective cyber-attacking operation conducted by UK Cyber Force and other ally nations against ISIS to disrupt terrorist group operations running 
            online propaganda and recruitment campaigns. The point of this operation was to restrict ISIS's levels of influence and its operations, which were flourishing
            in the digital space using different social media sites and websites to spread their extremist ideologies and recruit more people to encourage violence. The 
            operation damaged the ability of the group to operate effectively through the targeted destruction and dismantling of ISIS' communication infrastructure. 
            This is a general strategy to fight terrorism with innovation, underlining the place that cyber capabilities hold in national and international security efforts.
        </p><br>
        <h3> Detect and Track </h3>
        <p> Lebanon can detect and track the UK Cyber Force’s activities by using a combination of network monitoring, intelligence sharing, and proactive threat analysis. 
            First, Lebanon should deploy advanced Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to monitor its critical networks for suspicious 
            behavior and detect known techniques. This includes identifying indicators of phishing attacks and social engineering tactics, 
            which are common methods employed by the UK Cyber Force. Collaborating with regional and international partners through intelligence-sharing platforms 
            would provide real-time threat data, helping Lebanon stay informed about potential cyber threats. To track their activities, Lebanon 
            should use cyber threat attribution and forensic analysis in tracing suspicious activity to UK actors. Subscribing 
            to cyber threat intelligence feeds and tracking open-source intelligence and dark web would be good means of tracking the planning or execution of UK 
            operations. Partnering with private cybersecurity firms and forming dedicated incident response teams would allow Lebanon to continuously monitor for 
            vulnerabilities and suspicious behavior, ensuring that the nation is prepared to identify and counteract any potential cyber threats.
