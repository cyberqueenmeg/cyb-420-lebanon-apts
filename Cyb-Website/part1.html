        <h3>Polonium-Plaid Rain</h3>
        <p>This Group is believed to have been active since September 2021. MSTIC (Microsoft Threat Intelligence) states that they are highly confident this group is based in Lebanon. While Polonium has not been given an official APT number, this group is still big enough to be being tracked by multiple threat intelligence teams for its activities. MSTIC also states that they are moderate confidence that Polonium coordinates operations with multiple tracked Iranian Threat Actors based on victimm overlap, as well as common attack vectors and tools.  </p>

            <h3>Head of Cyberwarfare</h3>
            <p>Lebanon's head of cyberwarfare remains unknown largely due to the country's relatively small size and limited resources in the realm of cyberspace. Unlike larger countries with more detailed cyber infrastructure and better established cybersecurity frameworks, Lebanon's cyber capabilities are still developing. Because of this, the knowledge of who the head of Cyberwarfare is able to remain unknown to the public. </p>
