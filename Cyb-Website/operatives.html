                <h2>Head of Cyberwarfare</h2>
                <p>Lebanon's head of cyberwarfare remains unknown largely due to the country's relatively small size and limited resources in the realm of cyberspace. Unlike larger countries with more detailed cyber infrastructure and better established cybersecurity frameworks, Lebanon's cyber capabilities are still developing. Because of this, the knowledge of who the head of Cyberwarfare is able to remain unknown to the public. </p>
