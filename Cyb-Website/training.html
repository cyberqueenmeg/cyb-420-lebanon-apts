        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Training 1 - Penetration Testing</h2>
        <h3>Steps of Penetration Testing</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Define the scope, objectives, and rules of engagement to ensure safe and legal testing.</li>
            <li><strong>Reconnaissance:</strong> Gather information about the target systems through passive and active scanning to identify potential entry points.</li>
            <li><strong>Vulnerability Assessment:</strong> Use automated tools and manual techniques to identify and analyze weaknesses in the systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploitation:</strong> Simulate attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access and test security measures.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-Exploitation:</strong> Attempt to maintain access, simulate data exfiltration, and assess potential long-term impacts.</li>
            <li><strong>Reporting and Mitigation Recommendations:</strong> Compile findings in a detailed report with actionable recommendations to fix vulnerabilities.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h3>Benefits of Penetration Testing</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            Penetration testing helps identify and address vulnerabilities proactively, reducing the risk of exploitation by enemies. It improves overall security by strengthening 
            internal and external defenses. Testing also enhances incident response capabilities, ensuring quicker and more effective reactions to threats. By meeting international 
            cybersecurity standards, the cyber team can build trust with global partners while minimizing the financial and reputational damage of potential cyber attacks.

            <li>Develop clear roles and responsibilities for participants in the simulation.</li>
            <li>Secure necessary tools, platforms, and infrastructure for the simulation.</li>
            <li>Schedule regular training sessions and dry runs for all participants.</li>
            <li>Execute the simulation and collect data on team performance and communication.</li>
            <li>Conduct a post-simulation debrief to evaluate performance and identify areas for improvement.</li>
            <li>Update procedures and protocols based on lessons learned from the simulation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Training 3 - Phishing Email Detection</h2>
        <p>Social engineering is the largest infiltration method used by threat actors. To help reduce the risk of social engineering, users need to be trained on how to identify and report phishing emails.</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Training Content: Trainees will take an interactive course explaining phishing and how to detect phishing emails through methods such as checking who the email is from, hovering over suspicious links, checking with the sender in a separate communication channel to ensure it is from them, looking for grammar errors, looking for social engineering tactics such as urgency, authority, and other threats, and more. Trainees will be required to take and pass an assessment on this knowledge. This training will be administered annually.</li>
            <li>Test Emails: The cybersecurity department will send out test phishing emails on a monthly basis to see if users retain their training. Users who fail a phishing test will be required to retake and pass the phishing course again. Statistics will be collected on how many employees fall for the phishing email with a goal to decrease the number each month.</li>
            <li>Each year, the training and test emails will be updated with the latest social engineering trends and techniques.</li>
