        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>This report explores the Oxford Manual of 1880's four principles of warfare, which are military necessity, humanity, distinction, and proportionality. The principle of distinction is the most difficult legal issue facing contemporary combat. Through an examination of these principles and how they are applied in current conflicts, this paper makes the case that differentiation poses the biggest legal challenges because of the changing nature of warfare, urban combat situations, dual-use infrastructure, and technology developments.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>The Oxford Manual of 1880</h3>
        <p>The Oxford Manual of 1880, often known as the "Manual on the Laws of War on Land," is an important document regarding the codification of international humanitarian law. It was created by the Institute of International Law with the goal of providing thorough guidance for military operations (International Committee of the Red Cross, 1880). The Oxford Manual discusses a number of essential notions that have grown into modern warfare principles. These can be understood as military necessity, humanism, differentiation, and proportionality.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Military Necessity</h3>
        <p>The Manual understands that the purpose of war is to weaken the enemy's military strength. Article 4 declares that "the laws of war do not recognize in belligerents an unlimited liberty as to the means of injuring the enemy" (International Committee of the Red Cross, 1880). This principle recognizes that certain activities are required in battle, but it limits what can be considered militarily necessary and recognizes the humanity of both parties, as described below.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Humanity</h3>
        <p>The principle of humanity runs throughout the Manual. Article 9 forbids the use of poison or poisoned weapons, indicating concern for unnecessary suffering (International Committee of the Red Cross, 1880). This approach seeks to reduce the harshness of conflict while protecting both fighters and civilians from unnecessary injury.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Distinction</h3>
        <p>The Manual highlights the need to distinguish between combatants and noncombatants. Article 7 declares that "it is forbidden to maltreat inoffensive populations" (International Committee of the Red Cross, 1880). This principle underpins modern policies for protecting people in violent situations. This is significant because it prevents innocent civilians from being abused by soldiers, as has happened in the past.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Proportionality</h3>
        <p>The manual also addresses the topic of proportionality. The destruction of enemy property is prohibited under Article 15 unless "imperatively demanded by the necessity of war" (International Committee of the Red Cross, 1880). This principle contends that military activities must be balanced against the risk of civilian injury, and that any civilian harm must be justified by a high possibility of catastrophic repercussions if the military does not engage in a specific situation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>The Primary Legal Challenge</h3>
        <p>Among these four criteria, differentiation presents the most pressing legal difficulty in modern battle. The Oxford Manual established this principle, which has become increasingly nuanced in recent years (Corn, 2019). The concept of distinction, a cornerstone of international humanitarian law, compels combatants to distinguish between civilian and military goals throughout armed conflicts. This strategy has proven more difficult to use in current conflicts, particularly in metropolitan areas where soldiers may face civilian populations (Schmitt & Schauss, 2019). The advent of new technologies in warfare has hampered the application of this principle, raising questions regarding the ability to distinguish between legitimate military goals and protected humans or objects (Ohlin, 2021).</p>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>The piece at hand investigates whether using kinetic weapons in response to cyberattacks is appropriate. The appropriateness of kinetic military operations has become a hotly debated topic as cyber threats increasingly target key infrastructure. In addition to discussing expert viewpoints on the risks and efficacy of using kinetic force in response to cyber provocations, this paper assesses the consequences of kinetic reactions in respect to international law, namely the principle of proportionality. This research evaluates the appropriateness of using kinetic weapons as a defense against cyberattacks by consulting historical antecedents, contemporary military doctrines, and legal frameworks.</p>
        <p class="keywords">Keywords: kinetic weapons, cyber attacks, proportionality, military response, international law</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>The appropriateness of kinetic weapons as an appropriate response to cyberattacks is a complex and nuanced matter. Kinetic weapons are often viewed as a more severe form of vengeance than cyber warfare, which might have unpredictable or reversible outcomes (Sanger & Broad, 2018; Brooking & Lonergan, 2023). The proportionality principle of international law states that any armed response must be appropriate for the damage inflicted. This raises concerns about the justification of kinetic responses to cyberattacks (Vavra, 2019; Carlini, 2019).</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Many factors need to be considered in this discussion. First, there are many different kinds of damage that can be caused by cyberattacks. Some cyberattacks may cause serious physical harm or even death, while others may only cause temporary service outages with no lasting effects (Brooking & Lonergan, 2023; Vavra, 2019). When kinetic warfare is considered, proportionality assessments become increasingly complex. According to Sanger and Broad (2018), "The Pentagon's new strategy suggests that significant non-nuclear attacks could include attacks on civilian populations or infrastructure," emphasizing the significance of careful analysis when deciding the best course of action to take.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Second, the conflict is likely to become more violent in the future. Experts warn that utilizing physical weapons, such as nuclear bombs, in response to cyberattacks could exacerbate existing issues (Carlini, 2019; Brooking & Lonergan, 2023). Given the potential for vengeance operations to trigger new violent conflicts, state actors play an especially crucial role. "The inevitability of bombs falling in response to a cyberattack raises questions about the thresholds for using force," as Vavra (2019) points out, making it impossible to foresee results when shifting from cyber to kinetic responses.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Furthermore, the laws that regulate war provide critical standards for determining the proportionality of military operations.Any use of force must be appropriate for the threat and mandated by international humanitarian law (Fenton, 2019; Carlini, 2019). The difficult component is adapting this to the unique characteristics of cyberwarfare, as "the complexities associated with applying the law of proportionality... will leave civilian populations vulnerable" (Brooking & Lonergan, 2023).</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>In conclusion, while kinetic weapons may provide an effective response to cyberattacks, their usage poses substantial ethical and legal questions about proportionality and escalation dangers. The complexity of modern warfare, both cyber and nuclear, require a comprehensive approach that considers both immediate and long-term effects for international stability. Furthermore, developing realistic responses to the evolving range of cyberthreats requires continual cooperation between military strategists and policymakers in order to avoid utter nuclear calamity.</p>
